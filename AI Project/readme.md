# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE LAB PROJECT
### Solar Panel Data

This is our Solar Panel AI Project in which we are calculating efficiency of solar panel using current sensor and LDRs. LDRs are used as position sensor for auto adjustment of solar panel position, meanwhile current sensor are used to see what is the maximum efficiency at certain position of solar panel. Our AI model will predict the efficiency and what is the position where we can get maximum efficiency. We are using AI's linear regression method for this.
